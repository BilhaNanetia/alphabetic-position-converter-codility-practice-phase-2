# Alphabet Position Converter
## Description
This JavaScript function converts a given string by replacing each letter with its position in the alphabet. Non-alphabetic characters are ignored and not included in the output.
## Functionality
The `alphabetPosition` function takes a string as input and converts it by replacing each letter with its position in the alphabet. It treats uppercase and lowercase letters the same by converting the input to lowercase before processing. Non-alphabetic characters are filtered out and not included in the output.It then joins the positions array into a string with spaces and returns the result.
## Example
Input: "The sunset sets at twelve o' clock."
Output: "20 8 5 19 21 14 19 5 20 19 5 20 19 1 20 20 23 5 12 22 5 15 3 12 15 3 11"
